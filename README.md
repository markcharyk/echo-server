A simple echo server.

Execute the file echo_server.py in one terminal and leave it running

Exeucte the file echo_client.py in another terminal, and pass it an optional command line argument
It will continually prompt you for text to echo until it receives no input

I used the server/client outlined at http://www.devshed.com/c/a/Python/Sockets-in-Python-Into-the-World-of-Python-Network-Programming/2/ as a starting reference
